## Data Dao
Peer review system - Creating a database of certified scientific studies

What it does ?
- a dao that votes on and accepts quality articles
- then stores those articles on on filecoin network

A Scientific Paper Review DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that uses blockchain technology to facilitate the peer review process of scientific papers. The aim of this type of organization is to make the review process more transparent, secure, and efficient by using smart contracts and tokens. In a Scientific Paper Review DAO, authors can submit their papers for review. The review process is managed by a set of rules encoded as smart contracts, ensuring that the process is fair, transparent, and tamper-proof. The ultimate goal is to provide a more equitable and efficient way of evaluating scientific research and promoting the dissemination of knowledge in the scientific community.

## Flow
- people become member by staking 
- regular dao shits
- if proposal passed, article gets stored on filecoin
- dao members can remove any member if found cheating by passing resolution against him and his stake wouldn't be refunded
- if dao member wants to leave, he can leave after a fixed number of proposals and his stake would be refunded

- dao members can do token gated meetings with huddle
- dao members can chat with each other using push protocol 

- project gets deployed on spheron ( will have to get rid of build errors )
